# Investigate-a-Dataset
In this report, I will investigate the TMBd movie data using exploratory data analysis. The dataset was taken from a 'community that built movies and TV database'. Each row represents a movie which include a range of data. In the data wrangling phase, I will determine the appropriate datatypes for our dataset, and I will also show how to handle missing values. In the data exploration phase, I will first look at each variable and its distribution. After that, I will answer these questions:  How many of the Fantasy and Science movies are available? How is popularity trending over time? Which one of Science and Fantasy movie is more popular?
